A **CDN Proxy Server** is an intermediary server that sits between clients (users) and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). Here's what it does and why it's useful:

## What It Does

The proxy server intercepts requests for CDN resources (like JavaScript libraries, CSS files, fonts, images) and either:
1. Serves them from its own cache if available
2. Fetches them from the actual CDN and caches them for future requests

## Common Use Cases

**Performance Optimization**
- Reduces latency by caching frequently used resources locally
- Decreases bandwidth usage by serving cached content
- Faster response times for repeated requests

**Network Control**
- Useful in corporate/restricted environments where direct CDN access is blocked
- Allows filtering and monitoring of CDN traffic
- Single point of control for external resource access

**Development & Testing**
- Provides consistent resource versions during development
- Allows working offline with previously cached resources
- Helps simulate CDN behavior locally

**Cost Reduction**
- Minimizes repeated downloads from CDNs
- Reduces bandwidth costs in metered environments

**Security & Privacy**
- Acts as a gateway to whitelist/blacklist specific CDN domains
- Can scan resources for malicious content before serving
- Prevents direct tracking from third-party CDNs

## How The Code I Wrote Works

In the server I created, when you request:
```
http://localhost:3000/?url=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js
```

The proxy:
1. Checks if it has jQuery cached
2. If yes → serves from cache (fast)
3. If no → downloads from jsDelivr, caches it, then serves it
4. Future requests get the cached version for 1 hour

This is particularly useful for development environments or situations where you want more control over external dependencies.
